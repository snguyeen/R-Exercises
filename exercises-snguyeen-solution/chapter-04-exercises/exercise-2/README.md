# Exercise 2
Using the text-edit of your choice (e.g., Atom), create a new file called `README.md`. Alternatively, you may clone this repository and edit this file.

In your `README.md` document, make a three column table of the current courses you are taking, with separate columns for course number (in **bold**), course title (in _italics_), and instructor name.

Note that you can preview this Markdown in Atom to make sure it works correctly.

---

| Course Number | Course Title	    | Instructor   |
| ------------- |  ---------------- | ------------ |
| **COURSE 1**  | _Course 1 title_	| Instructor 1 |
| **COURSE 2**  | _Course 2 title_	| Instructor 2 |
| **COURSE 3**  | _Course 3 title_	| Instructor 3 |
